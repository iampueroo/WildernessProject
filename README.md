What is it 
----------
Bootstrap/jQuery fueled responsive website for the awesomest pre-orientation program offered at Washington University in St. Louis, the Wilderness Project.

Backstory
---------
After writing a LAMP stack site for my campus job, I was looking to dive into more client-side web development. I was introduced to Bootstrap through a lower level C.S. class at Wash U, and created this website in hopes of replacing the current one come Spring semester, 2013. 

Parting thoughts: Bootstrap is great, although I see it <strong>everywhere</strong> now. jQuery still makes things pretty. I don't know how I survived before SublimeText. I still prefer server side.
