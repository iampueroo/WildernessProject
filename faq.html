					<ul class="question">
						<span class="q">Q</span> What is the emphasis on social justice
						about?
						<span class="plus pull-right">+</span>
						<li class="answer">College is a time and place to explore new
							things and expose ourselves to diverse issues, cultures, and
							people. Discussing what students may encounter during their
							college life will prepare them to face these issues with an open
							mind. This trip is intended to increase our awareness of the
							natural world, ourselves, our peers and, in a bigger picture, the
							interaction of people and their environment in other places.</li>
					</ul>
					<ul class="question">
						<span class="q">Q</span> What if I have never been camping?
						<span class="plus pull-right">+</span>
						<li class="answer">Don't worry, many participants will have
							never been camping before. This is your opportunity to explore
							something new. Trip leaders will teach you all the basic skills
							you will need to be comfortable. The trip is one of the best ways
							to learn new things with the support of leaders and a new group
							of friends.</li>
					</ul>
					<ul class="question">
						<span class="q">Q</span> Why is the Wilderness Project longer than
						other Pre-Orientation Programs?
						<span class="plus pull-right">+</span>
						<li class="answer">The Wilderness Project will be an
							experience that immerses you in nature and your backpacking
							community. Enough time must be taken to go beyond backpacking in
							order to build a srong community and reflect on our experiences.
							Also, we thought it'd be fun to play out in the woods for a few
							extra days!</li>
					</ul>
					<ul class="question">
						<span class="q">Q</span> Why does the Wilderness Project cost more
						than other Pre-Orientation Programs?
						<span class="plus pull-right">+</span>
						<li class="answer">The program registration fee helps to
							cover a variety of expenses including food, leader trainings,
							gear acquisition, and transportation from the airport to campus
							and from campus to the woods.</li>
					</ul>
					<ul class="question">
						<span class="q">Q</span> What about Financial Aid?
						<span class="plus pull-right">+</span>
						<li class="answer">The Wilderness Project is dedicated to
							providing experiential education and outdoor recreation
							regardless of financial means. We offer two need-based
							scholarships. Please contact us if the program cost is
							prohibitive.</li>
					</ul>
					<ul class="question">
						<span class="q">Q</span> What kind of shape do I need to be in?
						<span class="plus pull-right">+</span>
						<li class="answer">Expect this to be a physically challenging
							trip. We encourage everyone to engage in some type of regular
							physical activity in preparation for the trip. While no
							backpacking or outdoor experience is required, please respect
							that hiking 8 miles per day with a loaded backpack demands that
							you are physically prepared. Pay particular attention to lower
							body strength; doing lunge exercises and situps before the trip
							will make those hills seem less steep.</li>
					</ul>
					<ul class="question">
						<span class="q">Q</span> Do I need any special equipment?
						<span class="plus pull-right">+</span>
						<li class="answer">Check out the Wilderness Project packing
							list. If you dont have some of the items listed there, borrowing
							from a friend, relative or neighbor is always an option. If you
							cannot get a hold of certain items, please contact us. The Outing
							Club also owns a large number of backpacks and sleeping bags to
							lend out. If you are getting new hiking boots, wear them as much
							as possible before the trip to get them well-broken in. This will
							help prevent blisters and make hiking more comfortable.</li>
					</ul>
					<ul class="question">
						<span class="q">Q</span> How else can I prepare for the trip?
						<span class="plus pull-right">+</span>
						<li class="answer">Once you have officially registered for
							the trip and received confirmation from the Wilderness Project,
							read our online participant packet and fill out the medical and
							policy forms.</li>
					</ul>
					<ul class="question">
						<span class="q">Q</span> When can I move in to my room?
						<span class="plus pull-right">+</span>
						<li class="answer">We will return to campus by 2pm on August
							25. You can move in at this time. Anyone coming to help you move
							in should also arrive on campus at this time. All of your
							belongings besides your camping gear should be shipped or driven
							in to arrive on the 25th.</li>
					</ul>
					<ul class="question">
						<span class="q">Q</span> Will I be able to move in to my dorm
						before we leave for the Wilderness Project?
						<span class="plus pull-right">+</span>
						<li class="answer">The dorms will not be available for
							move-in when you arrive on campus. You can move into your dorm on
							August 25th at 2 pm when we return. Plan on bringing the
							essential items for the Wilderness Project and have the rest of
							your belongings shipped or brought to you on or after the 25th.</li>
					</ul>
					<ul class="question">
						<span class="q">Q</span> Can I store belongings I don't need for
						the trip on campus while I'm on the Wilderness Project?
						<span class="plus pull-right">+</span>
						<li class="answer">Please bring only what you need for the
							trip with you when you arrive on August 18th. You should arrange
							for the rest of your belongings to arrive on campus upon your
							return.</li>
					</ul>
					<ul class="question">
						<span class="q">Q</span> What happens if I am injured before
						arriving on campus and can no longer participate?
						</li>
						<span class="plus pull-right">+</span>
						<li class="answer">If an illness or injury prevents you from
							being able to participate, please let us know immediately. We
							will accommodate your needs as best we can.</li>

							please don't hesitate to contact us and tell us about them! We
							will try our best to accomodate your needs.</li>
					</ul>
					<ul class="question">
						<span class="q">Q</span>What if I am on medication?
						<span class="plus pull-right">+</span>
						<li class="answer">Please list all medications (including
							inhalers) on your application. If you need assistance
							administering these prescriptions, please contact us so that we
							can make the appropriate accommodations. If you have a
							prescription for something not listed on your application (for
							example: you are diagnosed with strep throat 3 days before the
							trip), please bring a note from your doctor with you to campus.</li>
					</ul>
					<ul class="question">
						<span class="q">Q</span>How can my parents reach me if there is an
						emergency at home while I am on the trail?

							from 9:00 am to 5:00 pm, Monday through Friday at (314) 935-8350.
							After-hours emergency contact information will be distributed to
							parents before freshman arrive on campus.</li>
					</ul>
