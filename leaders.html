			<strong>Favorite Wildersnack:</strong> Anything that NomCom prepares because they're the best ever, no contest. True story. Don't believe any of the stories about missing cheese or Log-O-Beef. They're all untrue!
		</p>
		<p>
			<strong>Cruncy or Creamy Peanut Butter?:</strong> Crunchy, for sure. The textural integrity of peanut butter is compromised when the legume responsible for the superiorly flavored explosion of deliciousness that occurs in your mouth is itself excluded from the mixture.
		</p>
		<p>

		</p>
		<p>
			<strong>How many WP leaders does it take to screw in a lightbulb? </strong> Two. One to do all the dirty work and one to stand by their side in support leading up to the job itself, creating a Rocky-esque training montage. 
		</p>

			<strong>Favorite Quotation:</strong> "Hey, they laughed at Louis Armstrong when he said he was gonna go to the moon. Now he's up there, laughing at them." -Chazz Michael Michaels

			<strong>What causes the emission of short bursts of light from imploding bubbles in a liquid when excited by sound?:</strong> When a bubble formed by sound traveling through liquid begins collapsing, an environment of high pressure and temperature forms in the interior, causing the ionization of whatever gas is inside of it. The amount is so small, however, the bubble remains at an approximate 1-micrometer diameter. As the electrons of both ionized and neutral gas atoms interact within the bubble, electron waves of the respective particles continue fluctuating to maximum and minimum amplitudes. Given that the minimum amplitude also represents the point of lowest energy, when the two waves are superimposed at this lowest point, the pressure and temperature immediately drop. Thus, free electrons released by gaseous atoms in the process of ionizing are reincorporated into the electron shell of ionized atoms. Despite the relatively small drop in pressure, and therefore temperature, within the bubble, the large value of re-ionization energy is enough to excite the electron to a point where it releases a brief light pulse. I’m a science nerd, deal with it.
		</p>
		<p>
			<strong>Your greatest adventure:</strong> I believe my greatest adventure is yet to come! Sailing around the Gulf of Maine for two weeks on a sailboat doing oceanographic research was pretty darn cool though. 
		</p>
		<p>
			<strong>Advice for an Incoming Freshman:</strong> Don't be afraid to really put yourself out there and get involved around campus! Also, tip for better living: a spoonful of peanut butter straight from the jar is a completely legitimate snack during times of high-stress studying!
		</p>
		<p>
			<strong>Solve for x:</strong> This problem has plagued mathematicians for centuries and quite frankly, most would contest that it is impossible to prove... also, the answer is 69 (hehe).

Lift with Ben, pretend to be in a lot better shape then you are. Push yourself. Talk about the softness of your hands and try not to smile when he snapchats you doing dips.
Take a road trip with Forrest. Get in over your head with a girl who is out of your league and pester Forrest for advice on every life decision.
Participate in PLTL with Claire. Be super nervous when you sit behind her in chemistry and try not to chew too loudly.

			<strong>Advice for an Incoming Freshman:</strong> "First off, get excited! Approach college with enthusiasm and give it your all. It is important that when you get here, you stay true to yourself. Be who you truly are - this is a great time to start fresh and dispose of any facades you had developed during high school. Be warm, open to new ideas, and accepting of new experiences. Get involved in whatever it is you are passionate about, and try to make an impact.
But above all, have FUN! College should be some of the best 4 years of your life; make the most of it."

			<strong>Solve for x:</strong> "Everyone knows that Sex is Fun....<br>
Se^x = F(u,n)<br>
e^x = F(u,n)/S<br>
x = ln[F(u,n)/S] = ln[F(u,n)] - ln S<br>
so assuming S is a constant and F(u,n) is a continuous function,<br>
x = C + G(u,n) <br>
